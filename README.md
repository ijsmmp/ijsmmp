# ijsmmp

## Get Started

`ijsmmp` uses [Jekyll, a friendly, easy-to-use static site builder](https://jekyllrb.com/), which requires fundamental knowledge of CSS, HTML, and Liquid templates. Get started by forking the repo (via Github) and cloning your fork.

```bash
$ bundle install
$ gem install jekyll
$ jekyll serve -w
```

Then, navigate to http://localhost:4000/, and view the site in your browser.
